### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I build things, mostly with Go, Clojure, and Coffee â˜•.

In addition to my personal GitHub page, you will find my work at the following places:

- Open-source software: [CodeRafting on GitHub](https://github.com/coderafting)
- Articles: [CodeRafting website](https://www.coderafting.com)

It's been over 5 years since I have been building software. Previously, I did product management and business related things for about 6 years.
